                We will evaluate how clean your approach to writing CSS and Javascript
                code is. You can use any CSS and Javascript 3rd party libraries without any
                restriction.<br/><br/>

                If 3rd party css/javascript libraries are added to the project via
                bower/npm/yarn you will get bonus points. If you use any task runner
                (gulp/webpack) you will get bonus points as well. Slice service directory
